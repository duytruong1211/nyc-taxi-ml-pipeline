# âš¡ spark_full â€“ End-to-End ML Prototype with Spark, dbt, and Dagster

This folder contains a complete prototype of the NYC Taxi trip duration prediction pipeline â€” built with Apache Spark, integrated with dbt and Dagster for scalable transformation and orchestration.

It serves as a **production-style artifact** showcasing modular pipeline design, weather integration, feature store construction, and model evaluation using Spark ML.
